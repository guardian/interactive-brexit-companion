        Seriously? The US isn't in the EU, anyone who's been to Arizona or New Mexico
        will tell you it doesn't have control of its borders. The migrants and refugees
        who get as far the UK have often been through plenty of non-EU countries to get here,
        and those countries clearly can't control their borders. In any case,
        this latest wave of megration is not about lax borders but the products of a vicious war and 
        we're not in Schengen, so our control over our borders won't really change.
